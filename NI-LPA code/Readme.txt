Description:
in order to execute the program:

	 	we use Netbeans 8.2, "https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/"
	 	we use jung library from this link "https://sourceforge.net/projects/jung/files/" (jung 2.0.1)


this code is implemented in java and contains two classes: 

		"Former" to read input file ( four formats of file)
		"NI-LPA" is the implementation of our algorithm to detect overlapping communities.



Input file:  
a file contains the network (modify the name of the input file in the main class)


Output file:

the result is two files in the folder named Result:
	 	"Restest" contains graph partitions detecting by our algorithm
		"Nodeoverlap" contains overlapping nodes detected


***************************************************************************************************************

Example: 


*) Input file:
we use LFR-benchmarks to generate graph download from [1]
	
since the LFR benchmark is probabilist, in this exemple, we generate 3 instances named "network1", "network2", "network3" in folder named "test" with the same parameters as follows: 
		Number of node = 1000
		The average degree k = 10
		The mixing parameter µ = 0.2
		The maximum degree = 50
		The community size varies between 20 and 100 
		The number of overlapping nodes = 10%	
		The number of communities to which each overlapping node belongs = 2 
			
*) Output file:

the result is two files in the folder named Result:
	 	"Restest" contains graph partitions detecting by our algorithm
		"Nodeoverlap" contains overlapping nodes detected
	



*) Evaluation:

In order to compare our result with the ground truth partition given by LFR-benchmarks used Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) download from [1], the following directions must be followed:

Since NMI program accept a specific format, use our code named "Modify" to transform the format of the file (community generated by LFR benchmarks with network) that contains the partitions into a specific format accepted by NMI program. The format is like this: write the labels of the nodes belonging to the same cluster in the same line. (in folder "groundTruth", 3 files named groundtruth1, groundtruth2, groundtruth3 correspondent respectively to 3 graphs test1, test2, test3)
Apply the NMI function [1]


*) Result:

	NMI( Restest1 , groundtruth1) = 0,991111
	NMI( Restest2 , groundtruth2) = 0,99223
	NMI( Restest3 , groundtruth3) = 0
